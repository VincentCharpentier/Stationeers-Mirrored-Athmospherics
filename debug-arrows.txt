Problem with input / output arrows after flipping a prefab:
They are not pointing in the right direction and the spacing from the prefab is increased.

These are combinations I tried to solve it, the header in uppercase describe was transformation was applied to the 
Connection instance > Transform > Parent, which is a sphere collider (eg. SphereColliderPipeConnectionInput1Trigger).
The state on each line is the state of the Connection > Transform itself and the result obtained


PARENT FLIPPED & ROTATED:
none:          arrow direction & spacing ok / connection not working
flip:          arrow direction & spacing ok / connection not working
rotate:        connection ok / arrow direction & spacing incorrect
flip + rotate: connection ok / arrow direction & spacing incorrect
                 
PARENT ROTATED:
none:          arrow direction & spacing ok / connection not working
flip:          arrow direction & spacing ok / connection not working
rotate:        connection ok / arrow direction & spacing incorrect
flip + rotate: connection ok / arrow direction & spacing incorrect

PARENT FLIPPED:
none:          connection ok / arrow direction & spacing incorrect
flip:          ASSUMING SAME AS ABOVE
rotate:        arrow direction & spacing ok / connection not working
flip + rotate: ASSUMING SAME AS ABOVE

PARENT NONE:
none:          connection ok / arrow direction & spacing incorrect
flip:          ASSUMING SAME AS ABOVE
rotate:        arrow direction & spacing ok / connection not working
flip + rotate: ASSUMING SAME AS ABOVE

conclusion:
- flipping always useless here
- rotation fix visual bug but introduce functional bug for connections
